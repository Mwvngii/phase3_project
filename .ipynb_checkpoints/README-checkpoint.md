# CUSTOMER SATISFACTION PREDICTION ANALYSIS(PHASE 3 PROJECT)

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to generate insights and recommendations for business stakeholders in Maybach Airlines from building a classification model that predicts passenger satisfaction or dissatisfaction based on various flight service factors. This will aid in boosting its services to customers and increase customer retention.

## Business Understanding/Problem
Customer satisfaction is a critical aspect in the airline industry that quickly and directly impacts customer retention or customer drop off.

The airline company is experiencing a significant decrease in customer retention. Forthwith, by predicting whether a passenger experiences satisfaction/dissatisfaction we will be able to identiify factors contributing to passenger dissatisfaction thus drawing actionable insights and recommendations to improve customer experience and reduce customer drop off.

## Data Understanding
The dataset is sourced from kaggle containing over 129000 records and 23 columns covering various flight service aspects such as inflight_entertainment, customer_satisfaction and more.
It is a .csv file bearing the name airline_passenger_satisfaction.csv.
